# Eye Rest Notifier
This is a small python script which I have built for my personal use. I work in front of screen for long time. It was damaging my eye. Because we focus on the screen without taking rest for long time. Due to which we feel irritation in eyes.
So I decided to built a notifier for me which remind me to take a rest for at least 20 seconds and see far away to relax your eyes.

## 20-20-20 Rule
This is a rule according to which we should look at a distance of 20 feet for 20 seconds after every 20 minutes while working in front of screen. It will save your from damaging. It is very helpful. I am following it regularly and I feel my eyes relax due to this technique.
You should follow this rule ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š
